# Assignment 0 - Introduction to Git
## Due: 1-16-2017

## Author - Zachery Holderman



## Description

You are to follow the below steps to practice using GIT. This will help prepare you for submitting all of your assignments for this class.

1. Fork this project so that you have your own version.

2. Update .minttyrc with some sort of color changes. .minttyrc is a hidden file, so you may need to turn on hidden files for explorer, or use the -a flag from the terminal to see the file. I do not care what you change the colors to. Just change them so they are different.

3. Update README.md with the missing information for the following sections: (Just because you didn't need any outside resources, or have any problems with this does not mean you should leave the section blank. Put the word 'None' if there were/are none. Otherwise I won't know whether you filled out the README completely or forgot to do some of it.)

  1. Author
  2. Outside Resources Used
  3. Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program

4. Add/Stage the changes you made.

5. Commit the changes you made.

6. Push the changes you made up to GitHub.

7. Make a pull request using GitHub's web interface.
